 * @title IERC20ClaimableFacet
 * @author Utrecht University
 * @notice This interface is a base for claimable facets, where there is a certain amount of tokens claimable and an action to change that amount somehow after claim.
 * @dev This will not work with all claimable facets, but is nice base to not duplicate the claim code everywhere
 * There are also no exposed functions, as this would give function collision when adding all claimable facets to a single diamond.
