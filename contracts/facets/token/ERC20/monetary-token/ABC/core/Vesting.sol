/**
 * @title Vesting
 * @author DAOBox | (@pythonpete32)
 * @dev This contract enables vesting of tokens over a certain period of time. It is upgradeable and protected against
 * reentrancy attacks.
 *      The contract allows an admin to initialize the vesting schedule and the beneficiary of the vested tokens. Once
 * the vesting starts, the beneficiary
 *      can claim the releasable tokens at any time. If the vesting is revocable, the admin can revoke the remaining
 * tokens and send them to a specified address.
 *      The beneficiary can also delegate their voting power to another address.
